The AFUE differs from the true 'thermal efficiency' in that it is not a steady-state, peak measure of conversion efficiency, but instead attempts to represent the actual, season-long, average efficiency of that piece of equipment, including the operating transients. It is a dimensionless ratio of useful energy output to energy input, expressed as a percentage. For example, a 90% AFUE for a gas furnace means it outputs 90 BTUs of useful heating for every 100 BTUs of Natural Gas input (where the rest may be wasted heat in the exhaust). A higher AFUE means higher efficiency.","n/a","Efficiency Metric Qualifier","4af43a8f-ebba-442e-a670-9d12bc940fb6","Commercial, Residential, Multifamily","2019-11-26 17:07:16"

The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data. Census tracts are identified by an up to four-digit integer number and may have an optional two-digit suffix; for example 1457.02 or 23.  The census tract codes consist of six digits with an implied decimal between the fourth and fifth digit corresponding to the basic census tract number but with leading zeroes and trailing zeroes for census tracts without a suffix.  The tract number examples above would have codes of 145702 and 002300, respectively.","n/a","Identifier Label","224f52fa-2b57-4a3e-8956-2c94bd1996be","Commercial, Residential, Multifamily","2019-12-11 12:09:11"

Usually it is used in conjunction with a warmest reset strategy resetting the temperature of the air in the cooling supply duct. For each zone in the system at each system timestep, the control logic calculates a supply air temperature that will meet the zone heating load at the maximum zone supply air flow rate. The highest of the possible supply air temperatures becomes the new supply air temperature setpoint, subject to minimum and maximum supply air temperature constraints. The resulting temperature setpoint is the lowest supply air temperature that will meet the heating requirements of all the zones. When compared to a fixed heating supply air temperature setpoint, this strategy minimises central boiler energy consumption (if the hot water temperature is also reset or there are variable speed pumps) at the cost of possible increased fan energy (if there is variable volume control in the air system).","N/A","Control Strategy","8cdcbaa7-36c4-4ae7-80cc-ac4d16a31a40","Commercial, Residential, Multifamily","2019-11-26 17:09:08"

The rapidly moving hot air strips away the layer of cooler air next to the food and enables the food to absorb the heat energy. For the purposes of this specification, convection ovens do not include ovens that have the ability to heat the cooking cavity with saturated or superheated steam. However, this oven type may have moisture injection capabilities (e.g., baking ovens and moisture-assist ovens). Ovens that include a hold feature are eligible under this specification as long as convection is the only method used to fully cook the food.","N/A","Cooking Appliance Type","bb5860f0-501b-4091-a36c-753017935719","Commercial, Residential, Multifamily","2019-11-26 17:19:17"

Energy Factor (EF) is the quotient of the capacity equipment divided by the sum of the equipment electrical energy for mechanical operation or standby, and the water heating energy. The units are volume (or weight) per energy per cycle. For dishwashers, the EF is the reciprocal of the sum of energy per cycle, and expressed in cycles per kWh. The higher the EF value means a more efficient equipment. It is the ENERGY STAR energy performance metric. This factor may vary based on equipment features such as water heating boosters or truncated cycles. The federal EnergyGuide label on equipment shows the annual energy consumption and cost, which use the energy factor. The EF does not appear on the EnergyGuide label. Unlike annual energy use, the EF does not take into account the estimated annual energy use in standby mode. The energy factor for a dehumidifier is calculated by dividing the water removed from the air by the energy consumed, measured in liters per kilowatt hour (L/kWh).","n/a","Efficiency Qualifier","0c7a8485-8b74-49a4-b063-6ce3ff0c6155","Commercial, Residential, Multifamily","2019-11-26 17:07:16"

Trickling filters are composed of a bed of porous material (rocks, slag, plastic media, or any other medium with a high surface area and high permeability).

The wastewater is then collected at the bottom through an under-drain system.

The Home Energy Score uses a 10-point scale to reflect how much energy a home is expected to use under standard operating conditions. Homes that are expected to use the least amount of energy (and are considered the most energy efficient) score a 10, and homes that are expected to use the most amount of energy (and are considered the least energy efficient) score a 1. The Home Energy Score uses a standard calculation method and takes into account the home's structure and envelope (walls, windows, foundation) and its heating, cooling, and hot water systems. Only Qualified Assessors who pass a DOE exam are allowed to provide the Home Energy Score.","N/A","Assessment Program","ad6bed68-892c-4078-870e-958b41953f8d","Residential, Multifamily","2019-11-26 17:19:17"

With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the pressure pan by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the ductwork is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.","N/A","Duct Leakage Test Method","b48470c5-d5d5-4e26-8e92-df2d0392ba1d","Commercial, Residential, Multifamily","2019-11-26 17:07:14"

The dish-shaped surface directs and concentrates sunlight onto a thermal receiver, which absorbs and collects the heat and transfers it to the engine generator. The most common type of heat engine used today in dish/engine systems is the Stirling engine. This system uses the fluid heated by the receiver to move pistons and create mechanical power. The mechanical power is then used to run a generator or alternator to produce electricity.","N/A","Energy Generation Technology","d3107e23-f59e-452e-aaae-b7a43ff286d0","Commercial","2019-11-26 17:07:14"
